      <h2>History</h2>
      <p class="author">Author: John Reniel Cruz</p>
      <p>Centuries ago, the land that would become Apayao witnessed the migration of indigenous groups, setting the
        stage for its cultural diversity. Kankanaey tribes from Benguet and Mountain Province, particularly from
        Loo, Kapangan, and Tadian, joined by Ilocano groups from Pao Sur and Pao Norte of San Fernando, La Union, were
        among the earliest settlers in this region.</p>

      <p>The influx of migrants from Benguet and Mountain Province was driven by the &quot;Buso-buso&quot; tribal
        conflict, compelling them to seek new lands. Meanwhile, the Ilocano groups ventured into the area in pursuit of
        better livelihoods.</p>

      <p>The shaping of the region continued with the arrival of American colonizers, who established the Mountain
        Province on August 13, 1908. Apayao, previously part of Cagayan province since the Spanish Period, was
        incorporated along with Amburayan, Benguet, Bontoc, Ifugao, Kalinga, and Lepanto as sub-provinces of this newly
        formed province.</p>

      <p>The year 1966 marked a significant division, as the expansive Mountain Province was split into four provinces,
        namely Benguet, Bontoc (renamed &quot;Mountain Province&quot;), Kalinga-Apayao, and Ifugao. Kalinga-Apayao,
        along with Ifugao, was included among the provinces constituting the Cagayan Valley Region in 1972.</p>

      <p>A defining moment occurred on July 15, 1987, with the establishment of the Cordillera Administrative Region,
        elevating Kalinga-Apayao as one of its provinces. Finally, on February 14, 1995, Kalinga-Apayao was bifurcated
        into two independent provinces, a decision aimed at better catering to the distinct needs of individual ethnic
        groups within the region.</p>

      <p>The early settlers in Apayao subsisted by cultivating root crops like camote, gabi, and corn. Over time, they
        constructed terraces, referred to as &quot;Payew&quot; by the Kankanaey and &quot;Payao&quot; by the Ilocanos,
        for agricultural purposes. The name &quot;Payew&quot; was initially used due to the larger Kankanaey population,
        although it was officially recorded as Apayao when the area gained recognition as a Barangay.</p>

      <p>By the 20th century, the Isneg people became predominant in Apayao. Concentrated primarily in the highland
        municipalities of Kabugao and Calanasan, most Isneg settlements were found along the upper stretches of the
        Apayao-Abulug River, while others resided along a significant tributary of the Matalag River in Conner.</p>

      <h2>Demography</h2>
      <p class="author">Authors: John Reniel Cruz & Rayne Cristel Axibal</p>
      <p>The Apayao people, encompassing diverse subgroups like Isneg, Isnag, Mandaya, Ibulus, Imandaya, Imallod,
        Itne&rsquo;g, Kalina&rsquo;, Apayaw, Iapayaw, Idamma&rsquo;n, and Abulog, predominantly inhabit the northern
        Cordillera mountain ranges within Kalinga and Apayao provinces.</p>

      <p>This population coexists with various ethnic groups like Kalinga, Itawit, Negrito, and Ilocano farmers. The
        Apayao populace exhibits at least three distinct types, concentrated notably in municipalities like Pudtol,
        Kabugao, Kalanasan, and Conner. In lower areas adjoining rivers and floodplains, their agricultural practices
        involve riverine techniques, including slash-and-burn cropping and wet rice farming. Their diet consists of
        yams, taro, corn, sweet potatoes, and rice, which holds significance as a prestige crop. Residential setups
        typically comprise small familial hamlets with sturdy multi-family dwellings.</p>

      <p>The political organization among the Apayao people revolves around &quot;mengal,&quot; individuals
        distinguished in economics and leadership. Leadership isn't inherited but earned. Their cultural calendar
        includes ceremonies like &quot;sayam,&quot; often attended by affluent individuals, guided by female ritual
        specialists who also serve as mediums. A customary feature during ceremonial events involves mengals exhibiting
        pride near a ritual stone, a defining aspect of these feasts.</p>

      <p>Apayao's demographic landscape extends beyond its ethnic diversity to encompass a unique blend of cultural
        practices and social structures. These communities share territories with other ethnic groups like the Kalinga,
        Itawit, Negrito, and Ilocano farmers, fostering a mosaic of traditions within the region's northern Cordillera
        mountain ranges.</p>

      <p>Distinct Apayao populations are concentrated across strategic municipalities such as Pudtol, Kabugao,
        Kalanasan, and Conner, delineating varied cultural practices and livelihood patterns across these areas. Their
        agricultural techniques, adapted to different terrains, range from riverine agriculture in low-lying regions
        adjoining rivers and floodplains to slash-and-burn cropping methods. Rice, considered a prestige crop,
        accompanies staples like yams, taro, corn, and sweet potatoes in their diet, signifying the region's
        agricultural diversity.</p>

      <p>The socio-political structure among the Apayao people revolves around the &quot;mengal,&quot; individuals
        recognized for their economic prowess and leadership qualities. Leadership positions are achieved based on merit
        rather than inheritance, fostering a dynamic leadership landscape within the community. Cultural festivities,
        notably the &quot;sayam&quot; ceremonies, serve as cultural touchpoints, attracting participation, particularly
        from affluent community members. These rituals are led by female ritual specialists who double as mediums,
        maintaining cultural continuity and spiritual guidance within the community.</p>

      <p>Apayao's cultural ethos is punctuated by ceremonial practices intertwined with spiritual significance. At these
        events, mengals boast near ritual stones, emblematic of their cultural identity and the ceremonial essence of
        these gatherings. These events serve not just as social gatherings but also as preservers of cultural heritage,
        reflecting the depth and vibrancy of Apayao's cultural tapestry.</p>

      <p>The Apayao demographic landscape is characterized by a rich interplay of customs and traditions, fostering a
        unique socio-cultural environment. This cultural diversity is evident in the region's cohabitation of various
        ethnic groups, including the Apayao people alongside the Kalinga, Itawit, Negrito, and Ilocano farmers,
        contributing to the multifaceted tapestry of cultural practices and beliefs in the northern Cordillera mountain
        ranges.</p>

      <p>Distinct Apayao populations concentrated in municipalities like Pudtol, Kabugao, Kalanasan, and Conner exhibit
        diverse agricultural techniques shaped by geographical factors. Riverine agriculture and slash-and-burn cropping
        techniques prevail in different terrains, reflecting a deep-rooted connection between the community and its
        environment. The significance of rice as a prestige crop, alongside staples like yams, taro, corn, and sweet
        potatoes, underscores the agricultural diversity and resilience of these communities.</p>

      <p>The socio-political framework within Apayao centers around the &quot;mengal,&quot; individuals distinguished
        for their economic prowess and leadership qualities. This non-hereditary leadership structure fosters a dynamic
        leadership landscape, promoting merit-based ascendancy and adaptability within the community. Cultural
        celebrations, especially the &quot;sayam&quot; ceremonies, serve as cultural anchors, attracting active
        participation from influential members and guided by female ritual specialists who play vital roles in
        preserving traditions and spiritual guidance.</p>

      <p>Apayao's cultural identity thrives through ceremonial practices intertwined with cultural significance. The
        display of pride by mengals near ritual stones during these gatherings symbolizes the community's deep-rooted
        cultural heritage and the symbolic essence of these occasions. These ceremonial events serve as both social
        gatherings and preservers of cultural legacy, embodying the depth and richness of Apayao's cultural identity.

      <h2>Geography</h2>
      <p class="author">Authors: John Reniel Cruz & Mark Kevin Cawilan</p>
      <p>Apayao, situated in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) of the Philippines, lies in the northern expanse
        of Luzon Island. Kabugao serves as its capital. The province is entirely landlocked, bordered by Cabugao to the
        north and east, Cagayan to the west, and Abra and Ilocos Norte to the east. To the south, it shares its
        boundaries with Kalinga. Until 1995, Kalinga and Apayao comprised a unified province, known as Kalinga-Apayao.
        However, recognizing distinct regional needs and diverse cultures, they were divided into separate provinces.
        Apayao spans 4,413.35 square kilometers (1,704.00 square miles), boasting an extensive landscape.</p>

      <p>The province's topography features rugged terrains and mountainous landscapes, characteristic of the Cordillera
        mountain range. It's traversed by rivers and streams, notably the Apayao River, serving as a prominent
        geographical feature and a vital resource for the province. This river system sustains agriculture and various
        economic activities within the region. Apayao's terrain comprises valleys, plateaus, and forests, contributing
        to its diverse ecosystem.</p>

      <p>Within its boundaries lie natural reserves and protected areas, preserving biodiversity and indigenous flora
        and fauna. The protected areas include the Calanasan Forest Reserve, a habitat for various wildlife species.
        Apayao's climate is generally characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons, typical of tropical regions. The
        dry season typically spans from November to April, while the wet season prevails from May to October.</p>

      <p>Apayao's economy primarily revolves around agriculture, with rice, corn, and root crops among its key
        agricultural products. Livestock farming also plays a significant role in the province's economy. Small-scale
        industries, such as weaving, handicrafts, and woodcarving, contribute to the local economy. The province also
        taps into mining activities, primarily for gold and limestone, contributing to its economic landscape.</p>

      <p>The province's demographic composition encompasses various indigenous groups, each with unique cultural
        traditions and practices. Indigenous communities, including the Isnag, Isneg, and Kalinga, form an integral part
        of Apayao's cultural tapestry. These communities preserve their traditions, dialects, and customary practices,
        contributing to the province's cultural diversity.</p>

      <h2>Languages</h2>
      <p class="author">Authors: John Reniel Cruz, Jerrick Zeus Tabilin, & Brendell Nicholas</p>
      <p>The Apayao people possess a diverse linguistic landscape, comprising several languages significant to their
        cultural identity and heritage.</p>

      <p>One such language is Isneg, also known as Isnag or Maragat, predominantly spoken in the Cordillera
        Administrative Region within Northern Luzon. Its roots trace back to the Austronesian language family, with
        influences across the Pacific region. Isneg is prevalent in parts of Apayao, Cagayan, Abra, and Ilocos Norte
        Provinces. It incorporates unique linguistic features, including a 22-letter alphabet, characterized by a
        glottal stop marker denoted by the symbol &quot;&#660;.&quot; This marker, used after consonants, distinguishes
        between words with similar spellings but varying meanings, enriching communication nuances.</p>

      <p>Ibanag, an Austronesian language native to the Ibanag people, thrives primarily in the Cagayan Valley region
        and northern Luzon, including Apayao. Despite its fewer speakers compared to some Philippine languages, it holds
        cultural and linguistic importance within its native territory. Its relation to other Philippine languages
        accentuates the country's linguistic diversity.</p>

      <p>Itawis, closely connected to Ibanag and Ilocano, is a Northern Philippine dialect spoken by the Itawis people
        inhabiting the Cagayan Valley province. Itawis introduces distinct consonants like z, f, j (pronounced like dy
        but sounding like j), and v, distinguishing it from other Philippine dialects. Its linguistic and cultural
        affinity with Ibanag fosters mutual understanding, allowing speakers of both dialects to comprehend each other
        easily.</p>

      <p>Kankanaey, an Austronesian language, flourishes among the Kankanaey people in the Benguet province of Luzon.
        Predominantly spoken in the Cordillera region, it is an integral part of the indigenous languages in the area.
        Traditionally oral, Kankanaey possesses a rich heritage of oral literature, storytelling, and song. Efforts have
        been underway to develop a writing system, marking a transition from its predominantly oral tradition.</p>

      <p>These languages embody the cultural heritage and diversity of the Apayao people, reflecting historical and
        linguistic intricacies that enrich the region's cultural tapestry. Their significance lies not only in
        linguistic communication but also in preserving the indigenous identity and heritage of the communities they
        represent.</p>

      <h2>Culture</h2>
      <p class="author">Authors: John Reniel Cruz, Jeffrey Takinan, & Azailu Jendrick Bautista</p>
      <p>Among the Isnags of Apayao, spirituality remains a prominent aspect of their cultural fabric. Much akin to
        other Igorot communities, the Isnags exhibit a deep-rooted belief in spiritual forces. Central to their
        spirituality is the reverence for God, referred to as Alawagan, and various spirits inhabiting their
        environment. Isnags attribute their abundant environmental resources to these spiritual entities. Rituals form a
        crucial part of Isnag spirituality, performed at specific times using symbolic materials to impart effectiveness
        and binding power. These rituals serve diverse purposes, including healing&mdash;addressing physical, spiritual,
        or psychological ailments.</p>

      <p>The Isnags' rituals revolve significantly around their belief in environmental spirits, dictating their way of
        life. A comprehensive interview conducted with a tribal leader, Sabina Abgao from Kumao, Kabugao, Apayao, in
        April 2008 shed light on the features and significance of these rituals. Subsequently, the article underwent
        review and validation by Director Henry Aliten, a native of Calanasan, Apayao. Additional validation occurred
        through a focus group discussion and the assessment of an article titled &quot;Apayao: Home of the Isnag
        Tribe&quot; by Miguel Vasquez, published in the Baguio Midland Courier on April 27, 2008. The discussed rituals,
        particularly Say-am and Pildap, are essential facets of Isnag cultural practices.</p>

      <p>Say-am, a crucial religious ritual among the Isnags, serves as a community affair attended by villagers from
        neighboring areas. It operates as a cleansing ritual, especially if hosted by those undergoing a period of
        mourning. This ceremony marks the conclusion of mourning, allowing the harvest and consumption of previously
        taboo plants. Say-am, also observed as a thanksgiving ritual, often hosted by affluent Isnags, emphasizes
        gratitude and sharing of blessings. The celebration involves prayer, dance, feasting, and the slaughter of large
        animals like cattle and pigs.</p>

      <p>Pildap, another communal affair akin to Say-am but less elaborate, involves the sacrifice of smaller animals
        like dogs or chickens. Its purpose extends to signifying events, seeking healing, requesting prayers for health,
        prosperity, or the inauguration of a new household. Moreover, Pildap marks significant life events like a man's
        first adult haircut or serves as a healing ritual for an ailing family member. Additionally, it involves
        community-based assistance during agricultural activities like house construction, rice planting, or harvesting,
        following the principle of Bayanihan, wherein volunteers help without compensation.</p>

      <p>Both Say-am and Pildap hold paramount significance among the Isnags, functioning as platforms to express
        gratitude to the divine for health, resources, and life. These rituals also serve as a communal bond, uniting
        individuals through shared food, resources, prayers, and the reinforcement of friendships, cooperation, and
        unity within the community.</p>
