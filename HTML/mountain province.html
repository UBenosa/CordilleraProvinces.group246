      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Mountain Province has undergone significant political evolution throughout its history within the Cordillera
        region. Initially, the entire Cordillera region was known as Mountain Province, established as a special
        province of the Philippines in 1907. It encompassed several sub-provinces: Bontoc-Lepanto-Amburayan, Ifugao,
        Kalinga, Benguet, and Apayao. The appointment of Samuel Kane as the Provincial Supervisor and Bontoc as the
        provincial capital marked its early governance.</p>

      <p>Further division characterized the province's development. A year later, Mountain Province was subdivided into
        seven sub-provinces: Benguet, Bontoc, Ifugao, Lepanto, Amburayan, Kalinga, and Apayao. Over time, Amburayan
        merged with Bontoc, and Lepanto united with Benguet, reducing the sub-provinces to five&mdash;popularly known as
        BIBAK (Bontoc, Ifugao, Benguet, Apayao &amp; Kalinga). This division continued following relentless demands from
        the mountaineers for better political and geographical organization. Various political leaders, such as Henry
        Kamora, Alfredo G. Lamen, Luis Hora, Duyan, and Hora, significantly influenced the province's subdivision.</p>

      <p>The culmination of these efforts came to fruition on June 18, 1966, with the enactment of RA 4695, the
        Subdivision Law of Mountain Province, under President Ferdinand E. Marcos. This legislation led to the creation
        of the five distinct provinces: Benguet, Kalinga, Apayao, Ifugao, and Mountain Province. The sub-province of
        Bontoc was renamed as Mountain Province, with Bontoc as its capital town.</p>

      <p>Mountain Province began its legal and official operation on April 7, 1967, a year after the Subdivision Law's
        approval. It commenced its governance under the leadership of officials like Luis Hora as Congressman, Alfredo
        G. Lamen as Governor, Victor S. Dominguez as Vice-Governor, and Board Members Pio Felwa, Alfonso Layug, and
        Alejo Manao. This significant day in the province's history was later recognized as the Mountain Province
        Foundation Day, commemorated annually on April 7, as decreed by President Fidel V. Ramos through Proclamation
        No. 14 on February 28, 1993.</p>

      <h2>Demography</h2>
      <p class="author">Authors: John Reniel Cruz & Vazir-Kazim Flores</p>
      <p>Mountain Province stands as a haven for diverse indigenous tribes and cultural groups, each contributing to the
        region's rich tapestry of heritage. Among these are the Bontoc People, dwelling in the Central and Northern
        Regions, the Kankanaey People situated in the West, and the Balangao People in the East. Alongside these
        indigenous groups, migrants from various parts of the Philippines have also made their home in this province.
      </p>

      <p>The term &quot;Bontok,&quot; signifying &quot;mountain,&quot; encompasses individuals sharing linguistic and
        cultural roots traced back to Bontoc, a municipality within Mountain Province. Self-referred to as Ifontok,
        these people exhibit a remarkable social and political organization. Early Spanish accounts describe them as
        robust, fair-skinned, and notably astute in their craft.</p>

      <p>The Bontoc, also known as Bontok, Bontoc Igorot, Guianes, or Igorot, settled in the precipitous gorge region
        along the upper Chico River system in the Central Mountain Province of Luzon. Historically recognized as former
        headhunters, their livelihoods revolved around hunting, fishing, and agriculture. An intriguing aspect of their
        culture is the presence of three distinct body tattoo categories: chak-lag&rsquo; (tattooed chest of the head
        taker), pong&rsquo;-o (tattooed arms for both genders), and fa&rsquo;-t&#277;k (additional tattoos for both
        sexes).</p>

      <p>The villages within the Bontoc community exhibit a structured layout, organized into wards known as
        &quot;ato.&quot; Each village comprises several ato, housing a varying number of houses and structured around a
        stone platform&mdash;a central point for headhunting ceremonies. Additionally, the ato also houses dormitories
        for unmarried individuals, acting as clubhouses and council rooms, all overseen by a council of elders.</p>

      <p>However, the rich cultural tapestry of Mountain Province extends beyond the Bontoc People, embracing a spectrum
        of indigenous communities and traditions. The Kankanaey People, situated in the western reaches of the province,
        boast a heritage deeply rooted in their agricultural practices, craftsmanship, and communal values. Renowned for
        their resilience and adeptness in terrace farming, the Kankanaey have cultivated a distinctive identity
        synonymous with their rich cultural legacy.</p>

      <p>Similarly, the Balangao People, inhabiting the eastern regions, contribute a unique hue to the province's
        cultural landscape. Their customs, beliefs, and social structures intertwine with the natural elements of their
        environment. The Balangao have maintained age-old traditions, often showcasing rituals and ceremonies that
        reflect their profound connection to nature and the spiritual realm.</p>

      <p>Migrants from diverse Philippine regions add another layer of diversity to Mountain Province's demographics.
        Their integration into the indigenous milieu brings forth a fusion of customs and traditions, contributing to
        the multifaceted fabric of the province's cultural heritage. This amalgamation reflects the province's ongoing
        evolution as a melting pot of cultures, where each community contributes distinct colors to the larger canvas of
        Mountain Province's identity.</p>

      <p> In essence, Mountain Province encapsulates a mosaic of indigenous cultures, each group bearing its unique
        practices, languages, and social structures. Their collective presence weaves a narrative that transcends time,
        reflecting the resilience, adaptability, and cultural wealth of the region. The intricate social organizations,
        rituals, and traditional practices of the Bontoc, Kankanaey, Balangao, and other communities serve as a
        testament to their enduring heritage.</p>

      <p>The province stands as a testament to the intricate interplay between tradition and modernity, where age-old
        customs coexist alongside contemporary influences. As Mountain Province continues to evolve, it embraces
        diversity as a cornerstone of its identity, fostering unity amidst its varied cultural tapestry. Each indigenous
        group, with its distinct heritage, contributes to the vibrant social fabric that defines the province, making it
        a reservoir of living history and a testament to the resilience of its people.</p>

      <h2>Geography</h2>
      <p class="author">Authors: John Reniel Cruz & Rho-al Chun Padilla</p>
      <p>Positioned 275 kilometers north of Manila, Mountain Province asserts its significance in the northern expanse
        of Luzon. The province's accessibility by land, albeit via winding mountain roads, presents both challenging
        traverses and stunning panoramas. Nestled in the Cordillera Administrative Region, this landlocked territory
        entices discerning travelers with its enchanting allure and cultural depth, anchored by the idyllic capital,
        Bontoc. Yet, despite its eminence, the province is prone to ambiguity: foreign references often label it merely
        as &quot;Mountain,&quot; while locals frequently abbreviate it erroneously as &quot;Mt. Province,&quot;
        occasionally leading to misconceptions about its true identity. The province derives its name from the
        Cordillera Central mountain range, gracing the upper realms of Luzon Island. What truly distinguishes Mountain
        Province is its rich cultural heritage interlaced with intriguing mummy caverns cradling naturally preserved
        relics and suspended coffins, illustrating a vivid portrait of its unique legacy.</p>

      <p>Spanning 2,389.43 square kilometers, the landscape of Mountain Province predominantly comprises mountains,
        occupying 83% of the terrain, while the remaining 17% unveils hills and plateaus that contribute to its diverse
        scenery. The region boasts picturesque rivers, cascading waterfalls, grandiose mountains, and enigmatic caverns
        adorning the terrain. The central and western areas exhibit rocky mountains and steep cliffs, offering a
        striking contrast to the predominantly flat eastern portion. The provincial boundaries depict a narrative of
        connections and disparities, bordering Isabela to the east, Kalinga, Apayao, and Abra to the north, Benguet and
        Ifugao to the south, and Ilocos Sur to the west. At the heart of Mountain Province lie ten
        municipalities&mdash;Sadanga, Natonin, Paracelis, Barlig, Bontoc, Besao, Sagada, Bauko, Tadian, and
        Sabangan&mdash;each contributing to the province's diverse cultural mosaic. Whether captivated by the rugged
        mountains and cliffs or enchanted by the serene eastern expanse, Mountain Province offers an immersive
        experience.</p>

      <p>Beyond being a mere geographic entity, Mountain Province encapsulates a tapestry of history, culture, and
        breathtaking landscapes. The province's elevation, with Bontoc situated approximately 1,000 meters above sea
        level, contributes to its allure, offering a refreshing climate and sweeping vistas across the mountainous
        terrain. The elevated position also instills distinct seasons, notably cooler temperatures, especially in the
        mountainous areas. Nestled within the Cordillera Central mountain range, Mountain Province stands at the heart
        of a region renowned for its rich indigenous cultures and traditions. Serving as a gateway to explore the
        broader Cordillera region, the province and its neighboring provinces offer unique cultural and natural
        attractions. Whether delving into cultural immersion within vibrant communities or reveling in the pristine
        landscapes, Mountain Province beckons as a gateway to the wonders of the Cordillera Administrative Region.</p>

      <p>The history of Mountain Province is an intricate tapestry woven with the threads of its diverse cultures and
        the contours of its awe-inspiring landscapes. Its elevated position at around 1,000 meters above sea level
        endows the province with a refreshing climate and sweeping panoramas. This heightened elevation not only
        delivers cooler temperatures, especially in the mountainous zones but also enhances the picturesque allure of
        its terrain.</p>

      <p>Nestled within the Cordillera Central mountain range, Mountain Province occupies a pivotal position in a region
        celebrated for its indigenous traditions. Beyond being a geographic enclave, the province acts as a threshold
        for those eager to explore the larger Cordillera region. Each neighboring province contributes distinct cultural
        and natural attractions, inviting visitors to delve into unique experiences.</p>

      <p>The province's allure extends beyond its natural grandeur. Its rich cultural heritage, with Bontoc as its
        capital, forms the cornerstone of Mountain Province's identity. The region is deeply steeped in the traditions
        and histories of its ten municipalities, each adding its unique hue to the province's diverse cultural mosaic.
      </p>

      <p>Whether captivated by the rugged landscapes of the central and western regions or charmed by the tranquility of
        the east, Mountain Province extends an immersive experience. Its labyrinthine roads present both a challenge and
        an opportunity, offering breathtaking views and unforgettable passages.</p>

      <p>Mountain Province's rich heritage is encapsulated not just in its geography but in the tales of its people, the
        vibrancy of its communities, and the treasure trove of its cultural narratives. It serves as an inviting gateway
        for those seeking an intimate exploration of the wonders embedded within the Cordillera Administrative Region.

      <h2>Languages</h2>
      <p class="author">Authors: John Reniel Cruz & Hans Christian Louis Magtoto</p>
      <p>The linguistic diversity within Mountain Province encompasses a rich tapestry of dialects and languages.
        Guina-ang, a village located around 15 kilometers north of Bontoc, serves as a vibrant linguistic hub,
        showcasing the Khinina-ang language&mdash;known colloquially as kalimi or 'our language.' This linguistic
        identity extends across eleven other barangays in Bontoc, such as Samoki, Dalican, Ma-init, Maligcong, and
        Tocucan, collectively forming the Central Bontok dialects. Meanwhile, Alab and Balili represent the
        South-western Bontok dialects, while Can-eo, Talubin, and Bayyo contribute to the Southern Bontok dialects.</p>

      <p>The Bontok language group expands beyond Guina-ang, weaving its linguistic threads into neighboring areas and
        even crossing provincial borders. Extending northeastward into Sadanga for Northern Bontok and southeastward
        into Barlig for Eastern Bontok, it converges westward with Kankanay in Sagada and Besao, as well as Kankanaey in
        Sabangan, Bauko, Tadian, and Benguet in the southwest. Eastward, it continues into Balangao in Natunin and
        southward into Ifugao Province, while also integrating with the languages of Kalinga Province to the north. This
        intricate web of languages forms the Central Cordilleran subgroup within the Northern Luzon languages.</p>

      <p>Mountain Province serves as a pivotal junction, interlinking diverse cultural and linguistic strands. The
        province's linguistic diversity has attracted scholarly exploration, with researchers like Reid (1974a)
        illuminating the intricate relationships and classifications within the Central Cordilleran subgroup. The
        languages here embody more than mere communication&mdash;they encapsulate the region's history, identity, and
        the enduring essence of the Central Bontok communities.</p>

      <p>Exploring the linguistic landscape of Mountain Province unveils a complex interplay of dialects and languages.
        The interwoven strands of the Central Bontok dialects across various barangays highlight the diverse linguistic
        heritage within the province. The nuanced differences and shared linguistic elements among communities in
        Guina-ang, Bontoc Ili, Samoki, Dalican, Ma-init, Maligcong, and Tocucan paint a vivid picture of the Central
        Bontok linguistic fabric.</p>

      <p>Beyond the boundaries of Mountain Province, these dialects extend their reach, converging with neighboring
        languages in a seamless linguistic fusion. The convergence with Kankanaey in Sabangan, Bauko, Tadian, and
        Benguet to the southwest, and the integration with Kankanay in Sagada and Besao in the west, showcases the
        dynamic intermingling of linguistic influences. Eastward expansion into Balangao and southern extensions into
        Ifugao Province emphasize the profound interconnectedness of languages in this region.</p>

      <p>The intricate linguistic web of Mountain Province has captured the attention of scholars like Reid (1974a), who
        have delved into its complexities, unraveling the intricate connections and distinctions within the Central
        Cordilleran subgroup. Beyond being tools for communication, these languages serve as repositories of a cultural
        legacy, preserving historical narratives, societal identities, and the enduring spirit of the Central Bontok
        communities.</p>

      <h2>Culture</h2>
      <p class="author">Authors: John Reniel Cruz & Mharc Jhermie Botolan</p>
      <p>The Mountain Province in the Philippines is steeped in a cultural heritage that finds its roots in a rich
        tapestry of oral traditions and a budding written legacy. These traditions, passed down orally, play a pivotal
        role in preserving the rituals, stories, and wisdom of the indigenous peoples. Among them, the Ifiallig
        community's oral traditions, conveyed through the Finallig language, encapsulate heroic narratives of their
        ancestors and form a cornerstone of their cultural identity. However, modern influences like technology and
        education have posed challenges to this oral legacy. In response, efforts to salvage these tales have resulted
        in their translation into storybooks and digital comics, a means of ensuring the survival of these treasured
        narratives.</p>

      <p>Conversely, the introduction of a writing system and formal education has ushered in a transformation in the
        written culture of the Mountain Province. This transition facilitated the documentation of indigenous literature
        and historical knowledge, providing a platform for the preservation and sharing of cultural heritage. The
        juxtaposition of oral and written traditions underscores the nuanced interplay between tradition and modernity.
        While oral traditions remain fundamental in safeguarding customs and values, the integration of written forms
        has enabled the preservation and transmission of cultural identity in a changing world.</p>

      <p>The written literature emerging from the Mountain Province&mdash;encompassing novels, poems, and short
        stories&mdash;paints vivid pictures of its people's experiences and aspirations. This burgeoning corpus of
        written works mirrors the cultural identity of the province, becoming a modern repository of its heritage.
        Alongside the oral tradition, this written literature stands as a testament to the province's resilience and
        serves as a contemporary reflection of its cultural wealth.</p>

      <p>Across the Igorot communities within the province, shared cultural practices such as animal sacrifices,
        intricate weaving, and skilled metalworking using brass and iron persist. Rituals performed to honor ancestors
        illustrate the deeply ingrained spiritual beliefs that continue to shape their way of life. These customs and
        practices, rooted in tradition, serve as living expressions of cultural identity, navigating the convergence of
        the past and present in the Mountain Province.</p>

      <p>Moreover, the Mountain Province's oral tradition, intrinsic to the cultural fabric, reverberates through
        ceremonies and communal events. The Bontoc people, for instance, perform the Hudhud chants during their rites
        and rituals, weaving a vivid narrative of their heritage into these gatherings. This oral tradition stands as a
        testament to their enduring customs and beliefs, passed down through generations.</p>

      <p>Simultaneously, the province's expanding written literature enriches its cultural legacy. Novels, poems, and
        short stories, reflective of the populace's experiences and aspirations, further illuminate the Mountain
        Province's cultural landscape. This growing body of written work serves not only to preserve the region's rich
        heritage but also as a contemporary expression of its identity in a rapidly evolving world.</p>

      <p>The Igorot communities, united in their practices, conduct intricate ceremonies involving animal sacrifices,
        intricate weaving traditions, and the masterful crafting of brass and iron. These rituals are a testament to
        their spiritual beliefs and serve as a bridge connecting their historical past with their present reality.</p>

      <p>Continuing to bridge traditional and contemporary elements, oral and written cultural expressions converge
        within the province, demonstrating the dynamism of Mountain Province's cultural legacy in the face of evolving
        times. This convergence embodies a harmonious coexistence between ancient customs and the embracing of new
        methods of expression, symbolizing a resilient cultural continuum within the Mountain Province.</p>

      <p>The Mountain Province's cultural heritage, shaped by its oral and written traditions, encapsulates the essence
        of its people's existence. These traditions, whether carried through generations orally or preserved in written
        literature, embody the values, aspirations, and lived experiences of its diverse communities.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, the province's written literary landscape serves as a mirror reflecting the societal progression
        and aspirations of its inhabitants. Through novels, poetry, and short stories, the Mountain Province not only
        preserves its rich legacy but also shares it with the world, providing insights into its cultural identity and
        evolution.</p>

      <p>The Igorot communities' rituals and practices are a testament to their connection to the past, blending
        seamlessly with the present. These ceremonies, steeped in tradition, underscore their deep-rooted spiritual
        beliefs and the enduring importance of ancestral customs.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, the Mountain Province stands as a living testament to the harmonious interplay between oral and
        written traditions, where the rich tapestry of cultural expressions weaves together the past, present, and
        future. This unique interweaving of cultural threads encapsulates the essence of the Mountain Province, a land
        where heritage is honored, traditions thrive, and narratives endure across time.</p>
